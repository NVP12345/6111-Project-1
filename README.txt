c)The language used for the implementation of this code is Java. The main file that should be executed is FeedbackBing.java. 

Usage:

ant
java -cp "FeedbackBing.jar:lib/*" FeedbackBing .9 musk

As the Bing Search Account Key has been registered explicitly into the code itself we will not need to specify it as a parameter while the main file is being executed. Moreover, the two parameters that need to be specified are the precision and the query respectively(in that order) as specified in the reference implementation.
Note: In the three cases documented in the transcript, precision has been inputted as 0.9 as requested.
